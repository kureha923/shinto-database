## Knowledge for Enjoyment

Those who have visited Shinto Shrines, Buddhist temples, Castles, etc. even once for sightseeing know that

**the explanatory signs are very difficult to understand**.

I believe there are three reasons for this.

1. There is no explanation of proper nouns such as names of people and places.
2. the terms used in the explanations are not used in daily life
3. The sentences are so long that it is difficult to understand what the main point is.

It is so long that it is hard to understand what the point is.

The reason why I thought it was difficult was simply that I did not have the "knowledge" to enjoy it.
Even if you read books and gather information locally to gain knowledge, it is necessary to organize the information because it is so miscellaneous.

## Organizing Information

Therefore, we will organize the information according to the following steps to make it easier to understand.

1. bite the information into pieces and remove the emotion from it.
2. fit the information into a logical structure like a markup language

By following the above steps, some information will be removed.
Specifically, the collected information is structured in a data format called "YAML" and then organized.

When something as ambiguous as natural language is organized in a uniform format such as YAML, it is inevitable that it will be difficult to organize.
In addition, although we take great care to ensure that the information is accurate, there will be mistakes because it is a manual process.

If you find errors or have suggestions for improvement, I would appreciate it if you would let me know on twitter.
I am not good at English. If you find any translation errors, please let me know.
